# Learning for satisfaction of European citizens

The intention is to determine, based on the results of a survey of
European citizens, whether citizens are satisfied with life.
Different learning methods will be contained in different files. R
took an hour for each iteration of KNN, so most of this will be
done in Python(3.7).
